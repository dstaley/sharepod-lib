# SharePodLib

This repository contains a copy of the open-source version of SharePodLib, "an efficient, lightweight class library for interacting with an Apple iPod device" written by Jeffrey Harris. The only modifications that have been made are adding this README, and the addition of the text of the GNU Lesser General Public License so that the GitHub UI displays the license as LGPL v3 (to match how the original Google Code repo displayed the same).

## License

According to a [Wayback Machine archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20110502064600/http://code.google.com/p/sharepod-lib), SharePodLib was released under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3. However, this release still contained the [original license](https://web.archive.org/web/20120110061852mp_/http://code.google.com/p/sharepod-lib/source/browse/trunk/Licence.txt) distributed with the compiled version of the library. In the interest of preservation, this repo also contains that original [Licence.txt](Licence.original.txt).

It should also be noted that this repo also contains bundled libraries ([SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), [ICU](https://github.com/sillsdev/icu-dotnet), [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib), [taglib-sharp](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp)) that are assumed to be distributed under the terms of their original license.
